# Yet Another Standardfile Implementation in Go

This project is **maintained for the basic features** as encrypted notes because on its own it already takes hours to figure out what is the issue when a breaking change or bug happens (e.g. [#87](https://github.com/mdouchement/standardfile/issues/87)).

People's pull requests that implement or fix extra features (revision, file storage, etc.) will be gladly reviewed and merged.

This is a 100% Golang implementation of the [Standard Notes](https://docs.standardnotes.com/specification/sync) protocol. It aims to be **portable** and **lightweight**.

### Running your own server

You can run your own Standard File server, and use it with any SF compatible client (like Standard Notes).
This allows you to have 100% control of your data.
This server implementation is built with Go and can be deployed in seconds.

### Client library

Go to `pgk/libsf` for more details.
https://godoc.org/github.com/mdouchement/standardfile/pkg/libsf

It is an alternative to https://github.com/jonhadfield/gosn

### SF client

```sh
go run cmd/sfc/main.go -h
```

Terminal UI client:

## Differences with reference implementation

<details>
<summary>Drop legacy support for clients which hardcoded the "api" path to the base url (iOS)</summary>

> [Permalink](https://github.com/standardfile/ruby-server/blob/0a48c2625afc21966b110e0f73a1ff7bd212dbf4/config/routes.rb#L19-L26)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Drop the POST request done on Extensions (backups too)</summary>

> [Permalink](https://github.com/standardfile/ruby-server/blob/09b2020313a54668b7c6c0e122bbc8a530767d06/app/controllers/api/items_controller.rb#L20-L45)

This feature is pretty undocumented and I feel uncomfortable about the outgoing traffic from my server on unknown URLs.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Drop V1 support</summary>

> [All stuff used in v1 and not in v2 nor v3](https://github.com/standardfile/standardfile.github.io/blob/master/doc/spec-001.md)

</details>

<details>
<summary>JWT revocation strategy after password update</summary>

> Reference implementation use a [pw_hash](https://github.com/standardfile/ruby-server/blob/0a48c2625afc21966b110e0f73a1ff7bd212dbf4/app/controllers/api/api_controller.rb#L37-L43) claim to check if the user has changed their pw and thus forbid them from access if they have an old jwt.

<hr>

> Here we will revoke JWT based on its `iat` claim and `User.PasswordUpdatedAt` field.
> Looks more safer than publicly expose any sort of password stuff.
> See `internal/server/middlewares/current_user.go`

</details>

<details>
<summary>Session use PASETO tokens instead of random tokens</summary>

> Here we will be using PASETO to strengthen authentication to ensure that the tokens are issued by the server.

</details>

## Not implemented (yet)

- **2FA** (aka `verify_mfa`)
- Postgres if a more stronger database is needed
- A console for admin usage
